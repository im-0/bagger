ORE miner, now unusable. Will keep here for reference.

Features:

* GPU mining using [repurposed hashcat](https://github.com/im-0/hashcat/tree/add-ore-keccak-256).
  Works on anything that supports OpenCL. Tested on AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX.
* Mining and transaction signing / sending can be run on separate machines.
* Multiple mining instructions per transaction.
